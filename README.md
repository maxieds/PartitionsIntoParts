# PartitionsIntoParts

A Mathematica package for computing the number of partitions of n into parts of the form pt+a for p prime and 0 <= a < p. Includes implementations of the respective partition functions, a Combinatorica Partitions-like function to recover the parts, and several more exploratory numerical routines to examine conjectures and/or properties of these partitions. Joint computational research with Hamed Mousavi who *MUST* learn Mathematica and should be able to do so after modifying this package with me!
