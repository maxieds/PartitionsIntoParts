# PartitionsIntoParts

A Mathematica package for computing the number of partitions of n into parts of the form pt+a for p prime and 0 <= a < p. Includes implementations of the respective partition functions, a Combinatorica Partitions-like function to recover the parts, and several more exploratory numerical routines to examine conjectures and/or properties of these partitions. Joint computational research with Hamed Mousavi who *MUST* learn Mathematica and *SHOULD* be able to do so after modifying this package with me!

## Usage of the package and examples

For instructions loading the package, general usage notes, and many 
examples with the package core functions, see the accompanying 
notebook file [hameds-partition-function.nb](https://github.com/maxieds/PartitionsIntoParts/blob/master/hameds-partition-function.nb). 
This file is intended to provide end user documentation. There is also 
individual per-function documentation available for most (if not all) 
*core* (not utility) functions in the package, e.g., 
``?HP`` or ``?PartitionsIntoParts`HamedPartitions`` will display the 
relevant usage strings for these two functions once the package has been 
loaded with ``<<`` or ``Get`` in *Mathematica*.

## License and permissions to use the experimental routines

This package is provided freely as-is with no warranty to users. 
We recognize that at this point there may be broader interest of 
prospective users of this package to have these special partition functions 
implemented in *Mathematica*. However, please be respectful of the more 
exploratory routines in so much as they have been written by Hamed and 
myself to experiment with new research topics in the theory of 
partitions of this flavor. As such, we ask that you do not use our 
experiemental data second hand to explore the same topics as we do, but 
instead use the general core routines to explore you own problems 
related to these functions. Thank you and enjoy the package!
